# UNO4_Board
*** WARNING: UNTESTED....CONTINUE WITH CAUTION. ***

An UNO form factor board with a AVR128DA28 processor.

This board is designed to be the AVR UNO R4 equivalent, it has a AVR128DA28 as the standard MCU.

The board has a number of faetures, such as a UPDI programming and UART programming onboard.
The on-board UPDI programming means a bootloader can be burned onto the MCU while it is on the board....No more external programmer required for programming via the ISP header!

The board has a jumper to select between UPDI, UART or AUTO mode for uplaoding programs. 

More text to be added, sorry doing this in my spare time....
